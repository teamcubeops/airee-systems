        <h1>Hello there! I'm Airee.</h1>
        <p>I have been providing systems management services to Minecraft communities since 2017. Through my years of experience implementing pragmatic solutions, I've solved countless problems for many businesses based in Minecraft and I'm sure I can solve some for you.</p>
        <p>My main focus is my managed services. I try to provide as much value as I can through as many avenues as possible but many of my clients find <strong>incident management, off-site backups, and included Linux work</strong> very valuable. Alongside these managed services, I am glad to talk about any special cases or one-off projects you may need completed.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to get in touch, any of the following channels are appropriate and I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

            "Airee took over our existing infrastructure at MineAlong/Playblocks & helped us scale out our operation from a few dedicated servers to upwards of 20 in an organized fashion. They're a go-getter who proactively advised us with ideas & systems using their deep knowledge and experience working with large Minecraft game servers over the years. Airee was an active member of our company who worked hand-in-hand with our development team to strategize game launches & updates for best player latency & server load optimizations. If I were opening a Minecraft network again, Airee would be my first call. Thank you Airee!"
